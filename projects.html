    <p class="p">My first project was a research project for my APCSP final. We were assigned to research about a tech innovation in the past few years. I chose the James Webb Space Telescope becuase it has interested me and I have been following its progress for a while.<br><br>
    This project included research about data, creating a infographic, and presenting a slideshow. I had fun making the infographic because I like graphic design.<br><br>
    I learned more about the telescope through the lense of data. This research was meaning full becuase it increased my knowledge and interest in space. </p>

    <p class="p"> This project was part of my freshman year art class. Our project was to create a "zoom zoom zoom" drawing (where some parts of the image were zoomed in) out of colored pencils.<br><br>
    This project entailed finding a reference picture, scale some parts of the image to create the "zoom zoom zoom" effect, sketch the outline, and add color with colored pencils.
    <br><br> I really enjoyed this project becuase I love working with colored pencils. I learned a lot about blending and layering colored pencils. This was my favorite project of the year and I am really happy with how it turned out.</p>
